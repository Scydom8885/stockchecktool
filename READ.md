1. There's issue on the placeholder , when " huai" tried to key in the number of the unit check , the number pad keep on flashing that won't allow us to key ina single of number . I had tried mine as " admin" , same issue happened too. Could you investigate this case , see which one is the culprit cause and let me know . Don't fix anything yet ! I need to know what is happening first .
2. Why the placeholder still out space and not align and not fix at all on my staff's phones and other device . There's 3 devices shows that the placeholder has not fixed and no changes at all even though he had fix this for so many times and update for so many times . But really a weird thing that my huawei , the only one got the placeholder align fix properly . Please investigate this matter , why we fix so many times but didn't solve the placeholder align issue on the other 3 phone devices . Don't fix anything yet .
3. Actually if I wanted to modify this check stock by key in quantity for each items , what is your idea on UI/UX since our Items are using tap tap method . It's my brother said he really wanted to know how much stock left for each items . So how should we modify our current UI/UX . Let's discuss first , don't proceed any fix yet !
